            <h2 class="abouthead1">About Me</h2>
            <p class="about_me_1">Hi, my name is Della and I am a qualified and insured holistic therapist with over 20 years of experience in Swedish massage and 7 years Hot Stone Massage Therapy. In 2024 I began my training in Myofascial Release Massage.</p>

            <p class="about_me_1">It all started for me when I had my first massge and was amazed how much my muscle tension was eased. I began to have regular treatments myself to keep the tension at bay, but also because I love being pampered! I really embraced the holistic idea of “treating the whole person” and signed up for my first training course.</p>
                
            <p class="about_me_1">Now, 20 years on it is widely recognised that massage and other holistic treatments go far beyond just relaxation and can have many other health benefits.</p>
                
            <p class="about_me_1">Massage can aid you and your whole health system, increasing blood flow, gently helping your digestive system, helping you feel energised, improving sleep patterns. These are just a few of the physical effects possible.</p>
                
            <p class="about_me_1">Today there is a marked increase in diagnosis of debilitating conditions such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia. Targeted massage can help to ease the symptoms of such conditions, providing relief with regular treatments.</p>
                
            <p class="about_me_1">Many people hold tension in their back and neck and target this area with treatment. Compliment this with the whole body treatment for pure relaxation. Treating your arms , legs tummy and face, or any combination of these is the ultimate relaxation experience.</p>
                
            <p class="about_me_1">Alongside the physical are the mental benefits, taking time for yourself is so important. You deserve to be pampered and taken care of. Take an hour or two for yourself to unwind and just allow yourself to fully relax.</p>
